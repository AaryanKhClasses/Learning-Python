# print() prints the given args(literal or a var)
print('Hello World')

# Comments
a = 1 # this is a comment and a comment starts with a "#" symbol!
b = "# this isnt a comment as it is inside of quotes!" # but this is a comment as it is not inside of quotes!

# Variables
# In the above example of comments we typed "a = somthing" and "b = something as well". Here "a" and "b" are called variables.
print(a, b) # this will print out the values of "a" and "b". 

# Multiple Assignments
c, d = 2, 'Another String' # You can define multiple variables in the order of the variables you assign
print(c, d) # This will retrun as "2 'Another String'" as the variables are defined in the same order

# NameError
# A "Name"Error is will be thrown is a value of a variable is not defined!
# variable # This will give a NameError as the value of "variable" is not defined!
