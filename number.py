# Numbers | You can use Python as a calculator too!
2 + 2 # This will give a result of "4" when printed!

# Python Operators
# Basic Python Operators
2 + 2 # The "+" operator "adds" the two number values!
2 - 2 # The "-" operator "subtracts" the two number values!
2 * 2 # The "*" operator "multiplies" the two number values!
2 / 2 # The "/" operator "divides" the two number values!
# The division in python will always return a "float" value! (See Float Below)

# What is an INT & a FLOAT
int = 3 # An integer is called as an int | Ex., `2, 6, 10`, etc.
float = 3.0 # A Float is a fractional value of a number | Ex., `5.6, 2.99, 3.0`, etc.

# Advanced Python Operators
5 / 2 # "Classic" Division retuns a float value (fraction) 
# This will return "2.5"

5 // 2 # The "//" operator "divides" the two number values and removes the "fractional" part! This is also known as "Floor" division!
# This will return "2"

5 % 2 # The "%" operator "divides" the two number values and returns the "remainder"!
# This will return "1"

5 ** 2 # The "**" operator is used for "exponents" where the first number is the "base" and the second is the "index"
# This will retrun "25"

# The "=" Operator
# The "=" operator is used for assigning variables!
